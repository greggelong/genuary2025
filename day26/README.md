# make a mirror using git

## we are not using the pixel array

## which has some problem with this the latest release of p5

##

the scaling wasnt working correctly Chat gpt helped

The problem lies in how you’re calculating the positions and drawing rectangles in the `draw` loop. Since you're scaling `x` and `y` coordinates using `vScale` while also trying to center the mirrored drawings, the alignment may not properly adapt to different screen sizes.

### Adjustments to Fix Drawing Issues:

1. **Double-Check Coordinate Scaling:**
   Ensure the `rect` positions properly align with the intended mirrored layout. Multiplying `x` and `y` by `vScale` determines the positions, but mirroring (like `width - x * vScale`) needs to match the scaling factor.

2. **Optimize the Drawing Logic:**
   Instead of calculating mirrored positions for every rectangle, use `push()` and `pop()` with `scale()` to handle the mirroring efficiently.

3. **Update Scaling Logic:**
   Ensure that `vScale` directly corresponds to both the capture resolution and the screen drawing.

4. **Simplify Mirroring:**
   Use a loop structure or symmetry approach to handle multiple mirrored rectangles without recalculating everything.

### Updated Code:

Here’s a revised version of your `draw` function:

```javascript
function draw() {
  background(0); // Clear the screen

  // Loop through the capture feed
  for (let y = 0; y < capture.height; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < capture.width; x++) {
      // Get the pixel color
      let colorAtXY = capture.get(x, y);
      fill(colorAtXY);

      // Original rectangle
      rect(x * vScale, y * vScale, vScale, vScale);

      // Mirrored rectangles
      rect((capture.width - x - 1) * vScale, y * vScale, vScale, vScale); // Horizontal mirror
      rect(x * vScale, (capture.height - y - 1) * vScale, vScale, vScale); // Vertical mirror
      rect(
        (capture.width - x - 1) * vScale,
        (capture.height - y - 1) * vScale,
        vScale,
        vScale
      ); // Both axes
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Mirroring Simplification:**
   The mirrored positions are calculated directly based on the capture dimensions:

   - `capture.width - x - 1`
   - `capture.height - y - 1`

2. **Avoid Overlap Issues:**
   This ensures that the mirrored rectangles align perfectly regardless of the screen size or aspect ratio.

3. **Background Clearing:**
   Added `background(0)` at the start of `draw()` to clear the previous frame and prevent overlapping artifacts.

4. **Dynamic Adaptation:**
   The logic remains tied to `vScale`, so it automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.

### Explanation of Mirroring:

- **Horizontal Mirror:** Reflects the x-coordinates around the center horizontally.
- **Vertical Mirror:** Reflects the y-coordinates around the center vertically.
- **Both Axes:** Reflects both x and y coordinates for a full diagonal symmetry.

This approach should resolve your scaling and alignment issues effectively!
